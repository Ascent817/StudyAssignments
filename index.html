            <p>The paleolithic period, also called the stone age, is the first 'age' of history. It lasted for millions
                of years. This age includes <b>all</b> hominids, not just humans</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The first stone tools were probably made over a million years ago</li>

                <li>15% of deaths happened at the hand of other people, higher than other societies</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Paleolithic culture</h3>
            <p>The societies of paleolithic peoples seem to differ widely, some being egalitarian, and others being
                brutal and violent. The religions were often animistic and centered on the natural world, and time seems
                to be expressed cyclically. Could have been inspired by the cycle of seasons, birth and death, tides,
                ect. With a cyclical worldview, a beginning or an end of the universe probably would have been a tough
                concept to grasp.</p>
            <h3>The End of the Paleolithic</h3>
            <p>The paleolithic ended when permanent settlements started to form, and agriculture began to be practiced.
                Agriculture resulted in individuals being less free and happy, but the population could increase. Social
                stratification starts to occur during this time period, as some people begin to accumulate land or
                possessions across their lives and generations. In a hunter gatherer lifestyle, it's not possible to
                become more 'wealthy', because individual possessions are limited, and food can only be obtained a few
                days in advance. Agriculture brought more insecurity, as if the crop fails, people starve. People had
                much less free time in villages. Thus began the Neolithic.</p>

            </ul>
            <p>During the Neolithic, agriculture and permanent settlements began to form. A more patriarchal social
                hierarchy began to form too. During this period, social stratification had not yet occurred, because
                long-lasting wealth and the ability for people to become very rich off of other's work had not yet began
                en mass. The specialization of labor was still a foreign concept, and most if not all were still
                farmers.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Started around 10,000 BCE, in the Levant</li>
                <li>Was a gradual transition away from a hunter and gatherer lifestyle to agriculture</li>
                <li>The "Fertile Crescent" refers to the river valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates, up through
                    modern-day Israel, Jordan, and Syria</li>
                <li>The first settled communities were pastoral, relying on roaming herds of animals</li>
                <li>No written language, government, or cities for thousands of years</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Neolithic peoples revolutionized humans' utilization of the natural world. Corn was deliberately
                changed to become more useful, and domestication also occurred. The Neolithic pattterns of life occurred
                independently all around the world, at around the time when the ice ages were ending.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Mesopotamia</li>
                <li>Norte Chico</li>

                <li>Babylon</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Early civilizations often were city states, ruled by monarchies. A prominent example was Uruk, the
                setting of the Epic of Gilgamesh. Large empires and such still didn't exist. Why don't larger empires
                pop up? The armies and social stratification already occured, so it should have almost immediately
                consolidated. In fact, why isn't our current global civilization more consolidated?</p>

            <h2>Early Empires</h2>
            <p>Assignments:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Ways of the World, pages 117-131</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A couple of the first empires included the Persian, Macedonian, Roman, Chinese, Mauryan, and Akkadian
                Empires. An Empire is defined by a state's control of other peripheral states and other political or
                ethnic groups. The Chinese and Roman Empires were the biggest, both containing around half the
                population of the whole world. Christianity, Buddhism, and the Chinese concept of the Mandate of Heaven
                all originated from the peace and stability these empires provided. Christianity was allowed to spread
                in the pax romana, Buddhism attained popularity when Emperor Ashoka converted to it, and the Chinese
                people judged their governments by the Mandate of Heaven to this day. Peasant rebellions, natural
                disasters, or any other drastic event was viewed as a sign that the current government had lost the
                Mandate of Heaven. While Ashoka's promotion of Buddhism ultimately disappeared in India, in Indochina
                and East Asia, Buddhism continues to flourish. Indeed, some of the first interactions between peoples of
                India and China were Chinese Buddhists going on a pilgrimage to sacred Buddhist sites in India.</p>

            </ul>
            <h3>Early Indian Empires</h3>
            <p>The first and biggest empire to come out of India was the Mauryan Empire, which stretched across all of
                India except the southern tip. It was founded by Emperor Chandragupta Maurya, and brought to its height
                by Ashoka. Ashoka converted to Buddhism later in life and sought to rule in accordance with dharma. He
                planted trees on the sides of roads for travellers, built hospitals, and left the ideal of a great ruler
                behind. The modern Indian flag has the 128-spoked wheel, a symbol of Ashoka, and uses the four headed
                lion as its emblem. The emblem is called the Lion Capital of Ashoka.</p>
            <h3>Hinduism</h3>
            <p>Hindus believe in the concept of Brahman, the idea that the whole universe has a universal conciousness.
                All gods are aspects of this formless Brahman, and are crutches in order for the limited human mind to
                understand it. The realization of this idea is called Moksha, but in English called just realization.
                The Buddhist parallel is called nirvana.

                started in India, and stayed there for hundreds of year. It then died out in India, but spread to East
                Asia on the Silk Road.</p>
            <h3>Daoism/Taoism</h3>
            <p>Daoism is about going with the flow, or "Way". It emphasizes action without intention, being simple, and
                spontaneity. It originated around 400 BCE.</p>

            <h3>Nubia</h3>
            <p>The Nubian kingdom existed on the Nile, south of Egypt. They fought and traded with the Egyptians, and
                actually ruled Egypt for a century. The Nubian's biggest city was Meroe, ruled by a monarch with
                complete power. The Nubian religion was very close to the Egyptian one, but with some small local gods
                and goddesses added. Later on, Nubia turned Christian, but the subsequent waves of Islam eroded
                Christian traditions, and is now a small minority.</p>

            </ul>
            <h3>Axum</h3>
            <p>Axum existed in the Horn of Africa (Eritrea/Ethiopia). Agriculture was highly productive there, and used
                a plow based farming system. They generated wheat, barley, teff, and other grains. It was also
                stimulated by the large volume of trade coming off of the Indian Ocean. The Axumite encountered
                Christianity in the fourth century CE, and remained majority Christian to this day.</p>

            </ul>
            <h3>West Africa</h3>
            <p>West Africa was a scattered collection of smaller towns, loosely connected to a larger one. These cities
                vaguely resemble the Indus Valley or Norte Chico civilizations. One of the cities in west Africa that
                has been studied extensively is Jenne-jeno, which at its height housed 40,000 people.</p>

            <h3>Maya</h3>
            <p>The Mayan cities existed mainly in the Yucatan peninsula through to Guatemala. They had a written
                language, but knowledge of it is limited.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Controlled the land, built terraces for agriculture and drained swamps.</li>
                <li>No central authority; the Mayan cities were controlled independently by kings or queens</li>
                <li>Astronomy and math were very advanced; the Mayans calculated the length of the solar year to a very
                    high presicion</li>
                <li>Built giant temples and pyramids without any iron tools</li>
                <li>Fell because of droughts, disease, and the Spanish conquistadors</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Teotihuacan</h3>
            <p>The Teotihuacan civilization existed to the north of the Mayans, in the Valley of Mexico. The largest
                city there was Teotihuacan, a city of over 200,000 people, greater than Rome. Teotihuacan was built on
                an island in the middle of a lake, and had large urban complexes. It may have also extracted tribute
                from surrounding areas. The people of Teotihuacan maintained a large level of control over the water,
                and built a massive dike to control the water level and seperate the freshwater part of the lake from
                the brackish water. The infrastructure was remarkably advanced, even built in with redundancy for
                maintanence. Teotihuacan fell mysteriously, and was dubbed "The City of the Gods" by the subsequent
                Aztecs.</p>
            <h3>Inca</h3>
            <p>The Incan Empire was located in the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by the use of
                extensive terrace-farming. The Incan economy didn't have large markets or a monetary system. The Incan
                king was called the "Sapa Inca", the "son of the sun". It was at it's height when the Spanish arrived.

            <p>The Silk Road was a loose collection of trade routes from East Asia to the Mediterranean. It was a major
                trade route from 200 BCE to 1200 CE. Luxury goods
                like silk came from China, making the trade route very lucrative. Silk was highly prized in Europe and
                the Middle East. It's important to note that no one trader actually made the whole journey from China to
                Europe. Instead, traders would specialize in a certain part of the journey, and then trade with other
                traders who specialized in other parts of the journey. The Silk Road was a major factor in the spread of
                Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam. The Parthian Empire provided a bridge from Central Asia to the
                Mediterranean and Africa, allowing trade to pass.</p>
            <h3>The Spread of Ideas on the Silk Road</h3>
            <p>While the Silk Road moved goods, ideas and religions also travelled on it. Buddhism spread into China via
                the Silk Road. Additionally, Islam spread into Africa. Ideas from the far east flowed into places like
                Rome. It's interesting how the Romans so readily imbibed ideas from far away places.</p>
